# Photon API
Photon API for plugins.

## How to build
We use [gradle](gradle.org) to manage the dependencies and build the Photon API. We provide the `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` in this repository. The simplest way for you to build Photon-API is probably to create a gradle project in your favorite IDE (you may need to install a plugin for that), and to copy the Photon-API's content into this project (replace existing files).
