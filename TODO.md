# TODO
Here are the tasks to do for the next API version (or a future one). Update this file when you start working on something,
and when you're done.
- [ ] ***BIG WIP (TheElectronWill)*** - Update the API according to the the threading model. See the discussion group.
- [ ] *WIP (DJMaxZPL4Y)* - Add an interface for each game entity + interfaces like Damageable, Tameable, etc.
- [ ] Refractor the EventsManager to record the plugin that registers an event listener.
- [ ] Allow object creation with a type, for example an entity should be created by calling `MyEntityType.create(some parameters to determine)`.
- [ ] Add something like a "metadata" or "data container" API to attach additional data to objects like entities. A piece of data would be identified by its name. *We should discuss about this: is it a good idea regarding performance and memory usage?*
- [ ] Talk about the protection API (AccessManager, etc.): how to make it better? What are its goals?  

**There is a discussion group [here (french)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mcphoton-fr).**
